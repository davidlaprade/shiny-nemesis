### The Genetic Fallacy

Consider inferences of the following form:

	(1) P believes that q only because of E.
	--------------------
	(2) Hence, P's belief that q is unjustified.

Here are some examples:

	Jim believes that abortion should be illegal only because he wants to control women.
	--------
	Hence, Jim's belief is unjustified.

	Jan believes that global climate change is real only because she is a Democrat.
	-------
	Hence, Jan's belief is unjustified.

	Francine believes that babies are fun only because she is a woman.
	-------
	Hence, Francine's belief is unjustified.

These inferences are as common as they are tempting, but they are all invalid. They are examples of what's called the *Genetic Fallacy*, schematized above. That schema is fallacious because it is possible for all of its premises to be true while its conclusions are false. The fact that a person's belief can be explained tells us nothing about the rational justification (if any) for his/her view. To think otherwise, it seems, is to conflate reasons with explanations.
