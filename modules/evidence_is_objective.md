### Evidence is Objective

Contrast two views about evidence: one says that evidence is subjective, the other that it is objective. To say that evidence is subjective is to say that part of what makes something (some observation, or measurment, or experimental result) evidence for some view is whether or not human beings bear certain psychological or phenomenological dispositions. Call this the the *subjectivist view*: evidential relations are (at least partially) grounded on human psychology. To say that evidence is objective, alternatively, is just the negation: facts about human psychology and phenomenology are no part of what makes anything evidence for anything else. Thus the *objectivist view* is that evidential relations are not grounded in human psychology.

Quine seems to have had a subjectivist view of evidence.
