## Paper  Outline

### Introduction
  - There are many tacit premises that go unstated in Street's argument; some of them are false 
 - Street has failed to establish her conclusion, and has instead shown something uninteresting
  - Her conclusion: "Contemporary realist theories of value [are . . .] [in]compatible with natural science"
  - She has shown:
     - people who's only evidence for their moral beliefs are their moral dispositions are unlikely to be correct about those beliefs
  - this is something we already knew from history
     - most people only follow their moral dispositions
     - history has been the story of large-scale moral errors after moral errors, e.g. slavery, holocaust, etc.

### Reasons vs. Explanations
  - There is a difference between a person's *reasons* for believing that p--i.e. one's rational justification--and the best *explanation* of his/her believing that p--i.e. what actually accounts for his/her belief. 

### The Genetic Fallacy
  X believes that p just because of y
  Hence, X's belief that p is unjustified	
  - examples
  - Inferences of this form are invalid because there is a difference between rational justification and the best explanation of belief

### Evidence is Objective
  - Two views about evidence: subjective vs objective
  - Objective = the evidence or rational justification that any given person has for his/her belief that p does not depend on the consitution of human psychology
  - If human beings had a different psychology/phenomenology--if they felt differently, or began to have different dispositions--this would not change evidential relations
  - Subjective = ~ Objective

### Street's Main Argument

1. Our moral dispositions are evolved. 
2. If they are evolved, then they were either selected for directly or indirectly.
3. Hence, our moral dispositions were selected for directly or indirectly [from 1, 2]
4. They were not selected for directly. 
5. Hence, our moral dispositions were selected for indirectly. [from 3, 4]
6. If they were selected for indirectly, then it is very unlikely that they are veridical. 
7. Hence, it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true beliefs. [from 5, 6]

  - this argument is sound

### Street's Main Conclusion
  - Her conclusion: "Contemporary realist theories of value [are . . .] [in]compatible with natural science"
  - strictly speaking, this is different from the conclusion of her main argument
  - but with two supplemental premises, it's easy to see the connection
    (S1) realism about value assumes that value is knowable/known--it wouldn't be worth the title "realism" if it didn't
    (S2) natural science (in particular: biology) shows that we don't have knowledge of value (from the conclusion of the main argument)    
    - hence, natural science is incompatible with realism
   
### The Conclusion of Street's Main Argument Does Not Entail Her Second Supplemental Premise

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Probability

### Evolution of Belief vs Evolution of Feelings
  - beliefs cannot evolve
  - tendencies to believe can evolve, where one has a tendency to believe that p iff it's psychologically easy to believe that p (i.e. believing p reduces stress, reduces anxiety, increases pleasure, is intriniscally desireable)

### Evidence for Morality
  - no ethicists draw moral conclusions from their moral dispositions
  - our moral dispositions are a mess
  - instead, they offer evidence
    - Kantians point to satisfaction of (various formulations of) the categorical imperative
    - Consequentialists point to causal relations between actions and other events
    - etc
 
### Objection: Dispositions are Our Only Grip on Morality
  - the various ethical positions are the result of trying to bring our moral dispositions into reflective equilibrium with one another
  - so saying that ethicists of those stripes are providing evidence is premature: they **think** they have evidence only because they are one step removed from the problem

### Moral Dispositions vs Moral Intuitions
  - the two are not the same
  - many (perhaps most) of my moral intuitions disagree with my moral dispositions
  - arguably I (and everyone else) is disposed to regard members of out groups as morally suspicious
  - cite psychology study

### Reply to the Objection
  - the various ethical positions are the result of trying to bring our moral **intuitions** into reflective equilibrium with one another
  - it's n
