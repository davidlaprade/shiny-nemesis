### Introduction

### The Genetic Fallacy

### Reasons vs. Explanations

### Evidence is Objective

### Street's Main Argument

### Street's Main Conclusion

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Probability

### Evolution of Belief vs Evolution of Feelings
  - beliefs cannot evolve
  - tendencies to believe can evolve
  
  - "In order for evolution by natural selection to take place with respect to a given trait, the trait in question must be genetically heritable. Yet it is implausible to think that the acceptance of a full-fledged evaluative judgement with a given content [. . .] is a genetically heritable trait. [. . .] In contrast, however, it is plausible to suppose that over the course of much of our evolutionary history, what I have been calling ‘‘more basic evaluative tendencies’’ were genetically heritable traits, where a basic evaluative tendency may be understood very roughly as an unreflective, non-linguistic, motivational tendency to experience something as ‘‘called for’’ or ‘‘demanded’’ in itself, or to experience one thing as ‘‘calling for’’ or ‘‘counting in favor of’’ something else." (118-119)
    - this strikes me as a distinction without a difference
    - how can one experience the world was "calling-for" some action without believing that that action is called for?
    - a similar question: can someone experience an object as red without believing it to be red? I guess they could, if they had goggles on
  - Street says: "My point here is instead the simple and plausible one that had the general content of our basic evaluative tendencies been very different, then the general content of our full-fledged evaluative judgements would also have been very different" (120)
  - "Imagine, for instance, that we had evolved more along the lines of lions, so that males in relatively frequent circumstances had a strong unreflective evaluative tendency to experience the killing of offspring that were not his own as ‘‘demanded by the circumstances,’’ [. . .]  in these and other such cases our system of full-fledged, reflective evaluative judgements would have looked very different as well, and in ways that loosely reflected the basic evaluative tendencies in question." (120-121)
