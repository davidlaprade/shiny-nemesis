## Paper  Outline

### Introduction
  - Street has failed to establish her conclusion, and has instead shown something uninteresting
  - Her conclusion: "Contemporary realist theories of value [are . . .] [in]compatible with natural science"
  - She has shown:
     - people who's only evidence for their moral beliefs are their moral dispositions are unlikely to be correct about those beliefs
  - this is something we already knew from history
     - most people only follow their moral dispositions
     - history has been the story of large-scale moral errors after moral errors, e.g. slavery, holocaust, etc.

### Reasons vs. Explanations
  - There is a difference between a person's *reasons* for believing that p--i.e. one's rational justification--and the best *explanation* of his/her believing that p--i.e. what actually accounts for his/her belief. 

### Evidence is Objective
  - The evidence or rational justification that any given person has for his/her belief that p does not depend on the consitution of human psychology
  - If human beings had a different psychology/phenomenology--if they felt differently, or began to have different dispositions--this would not change evidential relations

### The Genetic Fallacy
  X believes that p just because of y
  Hence, X's belief that p is unjustified	
  - examples
  - Inferences of this form are invalid because:
     (i) there is a difference between rational justification and the best explanation of belief
     (ii) rational justification 

### Street's Main Argument

1. Our moral dispositions are evolved. 
2. If they are evolved, then they were either selected for directly or indirectly.
3. Hence, our moral dispositions were selected for directly or indirectly [from 1, 2]
4. They were not selected for directly. 
5. Hence, our moral dispositions were selected for indirectly. [from 3, 4]
6. If they were selected for indirectly, then it is very unlikely that they are veridical. 
7. Hence, it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true beliefs. [from 5, 6]

### Street's Main Conclusion
  - Her conclusion: "Contemporary realist theories of value [are . . .] [in]compatible with natural science"

### Street's Main Argument is Valid and Sound

### What Doesn't Follow from Street's Main Conclusion

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Probability

### Evolution of Belief vs Evolution of Feelings
  - beliefs cannot evolve
  - tendencies to believe can evolve, where one has a tendency to believe that p iff it's psychologically easy to believe that p (i.e. believing p reduces stress, reduces anxiety, increases pleasure, is intriniscally desireable)
