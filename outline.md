0. Introduction
- Street’s paper has generated a great deal of criticism
  - citations…
- none of this criticism has taken the line that Street’s argument is invalid
- Street claims to have shown that moral realism is inconsistent with natural
  science
- taken at face value, her main conclusion does not follow from her main
  argument: there is a gap
- I here examine the three most obvious ways of filling that gap
- each of which in turn succumbs to a gap of its own
- I conclude that Street’s case is ultimately invalid
0.1. Roadmap
- lay out Street’s argument as she presents it
- explain why there is a logical gap between her argument and her main
  conclusion
- lay out the three most obvious ways of closing the gap
- draw a distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic probability
- draw a distinction between explanations and reasons
- show that the most obvious ways of closing the gap run afoul of these
  distinctions

1. Street’s Argument
- officially, Street’s argument takes the following form
Our moral dispositions are evolved.
If they are evolved, then they were either selected for directly or indirectly.
They were not selected for indirectly.
Hence, our moral dispositions were selected for directly. [1, 2, 3]
If they were selected for directly, then it is very unlikely that they are
veridical.
Hence, it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true
beliefs. [from 5, 6]

1.1. Motivations
- motivate each of Street’s premises
- conclusion: her main argument is sound

2. A Gap and Three Bridges
2.0. Gap
- step back: what does Street intend to show as her main conclusion?
  - MAIN CONCLUSION:
- Realism about value is false, i.e. there are no mind-/language-independent
  values in the world, and/or we don’t know about them
  - SUB CONCLUSION: 
- it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true
  beliefs
- in fairness to Street, let’s say that her argument is successful if it can
  show that realism is probably false
  - even then, this is a different claim than the conclusion of her main
    argument
    - realism says nothing about the probability of moral claims, nor about our
      dispositions
- moral dispositions don’t seem to have anything to do with whether or not there
  are mind- and language-independent values in the world
- nor do they seem to have anything to do with evidential justification
  - furthermore, there is no formal contradiction in holding SUB & ~MAIN to be
    true
  - what then is the connection between these claims?
  - this might seem to be an uninterestingly critical, nit-picky point to make
- it seems the jump from her argument’s conclusion to the main conclusion is
  sufficiently obvious
- Street has already done all of the hard work for us; she can’t be blamed for
  leaving out this small, obvious step
- anyone who can’t see the connection is being deliberately obtuse
- there are three obvious ways to fill this gap
our dispositions probably point to false beliefs, we follow our dispositions, so
we probably have false beliefs
it would be a huge coincidence if evolution guided us to the right beliefs;
there are no such coincidences 
the corruption of our dispositions shows that we are biased; biases require
increased epistemic caution; no such caution has been observed
we’d think as we do even if the claims were false; hence, our process is
unreliable
- each of these connecting arguments will turn out to be invalid
- I think the nit-picky point is ultimately right
- despite initial appearances, a compelling bridge for this gap is not
  forthcoming
- all of the most promising ways of filling in the argument themselves fall
  victim to gaps of their own
2.1.0. The Argument from Probability
- it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true
  beliefs
- most of our moral beliefs correspond to our moral dispositions
- hence, probably most of our moral beliefs are false
- if realism is true, then it’s not the case that probably most of our moral
  beliefs are false
- hence, realism is false
- Street seems to have this in mind when she says:
- [T]he forces of natural selection must be viewed as a purely distorting
  influence on our evaluative judgements, having pushed us in evaluative
directions that have nothing whatsoever to do with the evaluative truth. On this
view, allowing our evaluative judgements to be shaped by evolutionary influences
is analogous to setting out for Bermuda and letting the course of your boat be
determined by the wind and tides: just as the push of the wind and tides on your
boat has nothing to do with where you want to go, so the historical push of
natural selection on the content of our evaluative judgements has nothing to do
with evaluative truth. 121-122
- If we take this point and combine it with the first premise that our
  evaluative judgements have been tremendously shaped by Darwinian influence,
then we are left with the implausible skeptical conclusion that our evaluative
judgements are in all likelihood mostly off track, for our system of evaluative
judgements is revealed to be utterly saturated and contaminated with
illegitimate influence. 122
2.1.1. Probable Given the Evidence
- the probability of an event is always relative to a pool of evidence
  - probabilities are almost never stagnant
  - when that pool of evidence changes, so too does the probability
  - whether or not an event is going to happen is (presumably) fixed
  - probabilities reflect the strength of evidence we have about what is going
    to happen
- the assessment of probability for an event always begins with its base rate
  - the base rate R of an event type E = (df) the probability that any event of
    type E will occur, calculated as the average probability of each prior
instance
  - one calculates the base rate knowing nothing about the particulars of E’s
    instances
  - it’s what you would calculate if all you knew were the rates of occurrence
    of prior E type events
  - example
- suppose that in recorded history there have been 100,000 people who have
  smoked at least a pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years
    - suppose that among the 12,000 developed lung cancer
    - taking nothing else into account, then, we can say that the base rate of
      getting lung cancer for a person who smokes a pack a day for 20 years is
12%
- the base rate of an event reflects the probability of that event with respect
  to a certain bare-minimum pool of evidence
- suppose we are trying to figure out the probability that it will rain at a
  certain place on a given day in June-- June 22nd
  - suppose we are the weather channel
  - say that reliable records have been kept about the weather at this place for
    100 years
  - say that 30 of such years were years in which it rained
  - the base rate of its raining on June 22nd at this place is thus 30%
  - now, June 20th arrives and our viewership wants to know the likelihood of
    rain on the 22nd
  - there is now additional evidence which we can bring to bear on this event
    - we can see that there is a certain storm system at such-and-such a
      position from this place
    - suppose the base rate of there being this kind of storm at this location
      on June 20th is 5%
    - and suppose that 3 of the 30 years that it rained on the 22nd there was
      such a storm at such a location
  - using Bayes’ theorem, we can calculate a revised probability given the new
    evidence we have
P(A|B) = P(B|A) x P(A)
        P(B)
A = it rains June 22nd this year
B = there is a storm at such and such a location on June 20th
P(A) = base rate of 30%
P(B) = base rate of 5%
P(B|A) = probability that there was a storm at that location on June 20th given
that it rained June 22nd - 10%
P(A|B) = 0.1 x 0.3 / 0.05 = .6
- this much should seem intuitive
  - the probability of an event (quantum mechanics excluded) is not a fixed
    value
  - it changes as we revise the pool of evidence we have for that event
  - it changes in a way that we can calculate
  - just as it would be a mistake for the weather channel to stop at base rates
    in its predictions of future weather events it would be a mistake for us to
stop at the base rate in our calculations of the events we’re interested in
2.1.2 The First Argument Reconsidered
- here’s the argument again
- it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true
  beliefs
- most of our moral beliefs correspond to our moral dispositions
- hence, probably most of our moral beliefs are false
- if realism is true, then it’s not the case that probably most of our moral
  beliefs are false
- hence, realism is false
- the problem with this first way of bridging the gap is that it ignores
  whatever other evidence we might have for our moral beliefs
- consider an analogous argument
  - imagine a person, Smith, who believes only a few very basic mathematical
    expressions: “2 + 3 = 5”, “9 - 1 = 8”, and “8 * 7 = 56”
  - now imagine a computer picks random sentences out of the set of
    syntactically correct, basic arithmetical sentences
- suppose that the set of sentences it returns is identical to the set of
  mathematical sentences Smith believes
  - now, it is very unlikely that a computer picking randomly from this set will
    produce a true sentence of mathematics
  - the set of syntactically correct mathematical expressions is orders of
    infinity larger than the set of true mathematical expressions
  - should Smith thus doubt his mathematical beliefs?
  - should he conclude that they are probably false?
  - if this is all the evidence he had, then yes he should
  - but this is not all of the evidence he has; indeed, it’s only just the base
    rate
- here, the problem is that we’re confusing the base rate for the final rate
  - there’s a wider body of evidence to take into consideration when evaluating
    the probability of a mathematical expression
    - was the expression taught to us by a reliable source?
    - are there any good proofs of the expression?
    - can it be confirmed empirically, e.g. by counting fingers?
  - to only take the base rate into account in evaluating the probability of the
    view is to tacitly assume something that is false
- namely: that the base rate takes into account all of the evidence we have one
  way or the other for the view
  - and in the case of mathematics the omission is so obvious that no one would
    make this mistake
- my claim is that this way of closing the gap is (in all important respects)
  identical to the mathematical argument run above
  - Street has succeeded in showing two things:
    - that the pool of possible moral judgements dwarfs the pool of true moral
      judgments (if any there are)
    - our beliefs correspond to sentences picked by a random process from this
      pool
  - Note the similarity to Smith’s case
    - the pool of possible mathematical judgements dwarfs the pool of true
      mathematical judgments (if any there are)
    - Smith’s beliefs correspond to sentences picked by a random process from
      this pool
  - but it seemed obvious in Smith’s case that he should not doubt his
    mathematical beliefs just because of this
  - so too, then for us and our moral beliefs
  - to think otherwise is to be engaged in the weatherman’s fallacy of confusing
    base rates for final rates
  - this is the further gap that besets the first way of closing the gap between
    Street’s sub conclusion and main conclusion
2.2.0. The Argument from Best Explanation
- the argument is:
- it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true
  beliefs
- most of our moral beliefs correspond to our moral dispositions
- if (1) and (2) then it would be a remarkable coincidence if our moral beliefs
  were true
- coincidences require explanation in order for us to be justified in accepting
  them
- there is no good explanation of such a coincidence
- hence, something has to be given up: the only plausible candidate is that our
  beliefs are true
- hence, our beliefs are not true: realism is false
- textual evidence that this is what Street has in mind
  - Of course it’s possible that as a matter of sheer chance, some large portion
    of our evaluative judgements ended up true, due to a happy coincidence
between the realist’s independent evaluative truths and the evaluative
directions in which natural selection tended to push us, but this would require
a fluke of luck that’s not only extremely unlikely, in view of the huge universe
of logically possible evaluative judgements and truths, but also astoundingly
convenient to the realist. Barring such a coincidence, the only conclusion
remaining is that many or most of our evaluative judgements are off track. 122
2.2.1. Improbability and Mechanism
- consider a routine lottery drawing
  - I go to buy a PowerBall ticket and have the number generated randomly
- tomorrow comes and a number is drawn: it’s my number!
- suppose someone told you this story and that you didn’t have a way of
  verifying it’s truth
- would you say:
    - “really--your number was drawn?” (eyebrows raised with doubt)
- “that’s a very big coincidence, don’t you think?”
- “tell me then, if this really happened as you say, how did it happen?”
- “how did that random machine manage to select exactly your random number just
  when you wanted it to?”
- would a mechanism be called for in such a case?
- should you be skeptical about this story until one was provided?
- it seems not: you’re claiming that the process was random and you just got
  lucky
- there is nothing to explain
- skepticism in such a circumstance does not seem warranted
  - this even despite the fact that the odds of picking a winning lottery number
    are staggeringly low
  - we just don’t need anyone to be able to explain how this happened in order
    to accept that it did
- consider a different story
  - I just smashed your windshield ten minutes ago. Shattered it to pieces.
  - But right after I just felt so bad. So I replaced it. If you go outside now
    you’ll see it just as you left it
- suppose someone told you this story and you didn’t have a way of verifying
  it’s truth
  - here I think you would say:
    - “really--you replaced a windshield in just ten minutes?” (brow furrowed
      with suspicion)
    - “you just happened to have the right cut of glass for my make and model,
      and the tools at the ready?”
- “you cleaned up all that glass?”
- “you managed to acquire new inspection stickers and parking passes to my golf
  club?”
- “tell me then, if this really happened as you say, how did it happen?”
- “how did you manage to do all of this in so little time?”
- here you really should be doubtful of the truth of the story until a mechanism
  was provided
- it would really seem like a giant coincidence if all of the conditions were so
  as to make what you claim possible
- so why does one story demand a mechanism and the other not?
- both stories are improbable
  - it is improbable that someone would win the lottery
  - it is improbable that someone would repair a shattered windshield in 10
    minutes
- neither story can be independently verified
- answer: we are assessing their probabilities from very different evidential
  bases
  - for the lottery: the evidential base is just the base rate
- the number of possible winning combinations, and the fact that the drawing was
  random
  - for the windshield: the evidential base is not a base rate, but is rather a
    large collection of general causal facts
    - e.g. it takes time to find the right windshield for a car and clean up
      glass and procure replacement parking passes
- what we see:
  - when something is picked randomly from a large number of possibilities (and
    this is all we know about it) it is indeed improbable
  - but it is not a coincidence: it does not demand a mechanism
  - mechanisms seem to be demanded only when the causal facts seem to render
    something unlikely
2.2.2 Against the Argument from Best Explanation
- suppose the realist bites the bullet here and just says we got lucky
- which of the above stories does the evolution of morality (according to
  Street) more closely resemble?
  - the lottery, not the windshield
- why?
  - whatever traits our moral dispositions have been piggy-backing on are best
    thought of as having no relation to the truth/falsity of moral claims
    - so claims Street, anyway… quote??
  - what ended up selecting our dispositions, in other words, was random with
    respect to the truth/falsity of the moral claims it picked
    - a moral claim’s being true did not cause it to be any more or less likely
      to be chosen; ditto for being false
  - so Street is claiming that if we follow our moral dispositions, it’s as good
    as picking randomly
  - but picking randomly is only risky if there are many bad choices in the
    bunch: if the numbers are bad
    - this is why she points out that there are many possible moral judgements
      that our dispositions could have corresponded to
    - (if the moral realist is to be taken at his/her word) the number of
      possible moral judgements dwarfs the number of true moral judgements by
orders of magnitude
    - so again, the numbers are bad too
- these are exactly the circumstances we had in the lottery case
  - recall, the lottery case did not require a mechanism in order to be
    plausible
- so I deny the third premise here: if (1) and (2) then it would be a remarkable
  coincidence if our moral beliefs were true
  - there is no coincidence here
- the problem with this way of bridging the gap is that it mistakenly assumes
  that when the co-occurrence of an event pair is unlikely, it constitutes a
coincidence (something requiring explanation to be justifiably believed)
  - but this is not so
  - it is thus the further hole in this manner of patching Street’s case

2.3.0 The Argument from Epistemic Bias
- if evidential relations themselves depend up on the constitution of our
  psychology or on our phenomenology, and we've just shown that our
phenomenology has been altered by evolution to favor value claims, then
shouldn't there be a kind of extreme epistemic caution required to justify these
claims?
- argument
- it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true a
  liefs
- hence, we’re biased with respect to our evaluation of moral judgments
- if we’re biased, then extra epistemic care must be taken for us to be
  justified in our judgements
- extra epistemic care has not been taken
- hence, our judgments aren’t justified
- hence, realism is false
- consider
- suppose you're prone to a certain optical illusion, e.g. that black and blue
  dresses look white and gold to you
- normally, when you form beliefs about the color of clothes you move quickly
  from how things appear to you to beliefs about their colors
- but this time your friend Molly has asked you--at the last minute, on the
  morning of her wedding--to pick out a veil for her
- only thing: the veil has to be white and gold--those are the colors of her
  dress
- so you rush to the local Dress Barn and look through the headwear
- you find one that looks white and gold, and are about to buy it
- but would you be justified in buying it given that you are disposed to this
  illusion?
- Do you have good enough evidence to- henct? Would people understand if you
  bought it and were wrong?
- It would seem that, though most people in such a circumstance would have
  enough evidence, you do not
- you should consult a store clerk, or take a picture and send it to Molly first
- Because of what you know about how your phenomenology is misleading, an extra
  stringent epistemological standard applies
- we would seem to be in a similar predicament if Street is correct
  - we all have dispositions that are as reliable as picking randomly from a
    large pool of bad choices
  - shouldn’t an extra stringent episy thing: the veil has to be white and
    gold--those are the colors of her dress
- so you rush to the localen dress
- so you rush to the local Dress Barn and look through the hea o are about to
  buy it
- but would you be justified in buying it given that you are disposed to this
  illusion?
- Do you ide disposed to this illusion?
- Do you have good enough evidence to- henct? Woubsh evidence to- henct? Would
  people understand if yoemost people in such a r case
  - do we see these kinds of things amongst either ordinary people or trained
    ethicists?
- answer: no
- you see people digging in their heels, forming camps, insulating their views
  from possibly being discredited, embracing jargon
  - hence, it seems reasonable to say that no such extra stringent
    epistemological standard has been met
  - hence, our judgments aren’t justified and realism is false

2.3.1. Evidence is Objective
- consider two views about evidence: subjective vs objective
- Objective = the evidence or rational justification that any given person has
  for his/her belief that p does not depend on the constitution of human
psychology
- If human beings had a different psychology/phenomenology--if they felt
  differently, or began to have different dispositions--this would not change
evidential relations
- Subjective = ~ Objective
- evidence is objective
  - my saying this is based on the belief that what we know about the world
    would not be unmade if something was put in the water to make reds lookn
reen, e = mc2 look like a complicated view, ordinary claims look outlandish
  - the evidential base (even if we no longer are capable of having the
    phenomenology again) remains sturdy
  - we should remain convinced of our view of the world

2.3.2. Epistemic Bias Reconsidered
- this way of bridging the gap asserts that bias requires epistemic caution
- there are two things that might mean
  1. we should be more careful when evaluating evidence, but the evidential bar
     remains the same
  2. the evidential bar has been raised: the amount/quality of evidence that
     normally would justify a view is not enough in this case
- I think that 1 is true and 2 is false, on grounds of the objectivity of
  evidence

2.4.0. The Argument from Evidence
we believe our moral claims only because of our dispositions
our dispositions are as good as random
hence, our process is unreliable
knowledge is (at the very least) true belief formed by a reliable process
hence, we lack knowledge of moral claims
hence, realism is false

two complaints here:
first, this doesn’t bridge the gap; this is a new argument all together
second, the jump from 1,2 to 3 conflates reasons with explanations
we may well have a reliable process and yet the best explanation is something
else

our only source of evidence for our moral beliefs are our dispositions; this
shows that our only source of evidence is no good

Reasons vs. Explanations
There is a difference between a person's reasons for believing that p--i.e.
one's rational justification--and the best explanation of his/her believing that
p--i.e. what actually accounts for his/her belief.
The Genetic Fallacy
X believes that p just because of y Hence, X's belief that p is unjustified
examples
Inferences of this form are invalid because there is a difference between
rational justification and the best explanation of belief



Street's Main Conclusion
Her conclusion: "Contemporary realist theories of value [are . . .]
[in]compatible with natural science"
strictly speaking, this is different from the conclusion of her main argument
but with two supplemental premises, it's easy to see the connection (S1) if
accepted claims in natural science (in particular: biology) are true, then we
don't have knowledge of value (from the conclusion of the main argument)
(S2) if we don't have knowledge of value, then realism about value isn't true
------------- (MC) Hence, if accepted claims in natural science are true, then
realism about value is false
In other words, natural science is incompatible with realism

The Conclusion of Street's Main Argument Does Not Entail Her Supplemental
Premise
If our moral dispositions are evolved, then it is very unlikely that our moral
dispositions are dispositions to true beliefs Hence, natural science entails
that we don't have a knowledge of value

this is invalid
possible:
Jack's moral dispositions are the result of evolution by natural selection and
it is very unlikely that they point to true propositions
however, his dispositions are no part of what he takes as evidence for the moral
claims that he believes
as it happens, Jack's moral beliefs are true and, because his evidence was good
enough, constitute knowledge
in this case, the premises are all true and the conclusion is false -reply:
- we already know Street is assuming that we believe ethical claims **just
  because** of our dispositions
- does this allow her to derive the supplemental premise she needs?
adding the premise that we (everyone?) believe ethical claims just because of
our dispositions turns this into an instance of the genetic fallacy
the best explanation of our beliefs aside, we should be asking: what is the
evidence?
Street herself seems to admit this elsewhere: "If the causal process that gave
rise to one’s belief that P is such that (as far as one knows) there is no
reason to think that it would lead one to form true beliefs about the subject
Smither in question—and if (as far as one knows) there is no other good reason
to believe that P—then one should suspend belief that P" (from David's article)

Extreme Epistemic Caution
Street has a way out:
if evidential relations themselves depend up on the constitution of our
psychology or on our phenomenology, and we've just shown that our phenomenology
has been altered by evolution to favor value claims, then shouldn't there be a
kind of extreme epistemic caution required to justify these claims?
she then just has to show that moral claims lack the additional epistemic
backing to conclude that they do not constitute knowledge
this seems like a plausible way to reply
suppose you're prone to a certain optical illusion, e.g. that black and blue
dresses look white and gold to you
normally, when you form beliefs about the color of clothes you move quickly from
how things appear to you to beliefs about their colors
but this time your friend Molly has asked you--at the last minute, on the
morning of her wedding--to pick out a veil for her
only thing: the veil has to be white and gold--those are the colors of her dress
so you rush to the wedding store and look through the veils
you find one that looks white and gold, and are about to buy it
but would you be justified in buying it? Do you have good enough evidence to buy
it?
It would seem that, though most people in such a circumstance would have enough
evidence, you do not
Because of what you know about how your phenomenology is misleading, an extra
stringent epistemological standard applies

Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Probability

Evolution of Belief vs Evolution of Feelings

beliefs cannot evolve
tendencies to believe can evolve, where one has a tendency to believe that p iff
it's psychologically easy to believe that p (i.e. believing p reduces stress,
reduces anxiety, increases pleasure, is intriniscally desireable)
Evidence for Morality

no ethicists draw moral conclusions from their moral dispositions
our moral dispositions are a mess
instead, they offer evidence
Kantians point to satisfaction of (various formulations of) the categorical
imperative
Consequentialists point to causal relations between actions and other events
etc

Objection: Dispositions are Our Only Grip on Morality

the various ethical positions are the result of trying to bring our moral
dispositions into reflective equilibrium with one another
so saying that ethicists of those stripes are providing evidence is premature:
they think they have evidence only because they are one step removed from the
problem


Moral Dispositions vs Moral Intuitions

the two are not the same
many (perhaps most) of my moral intuitions disagree with my moral dispositions
arguably I (and everyone else) is disposed to regard members of out groups as
morally suspicious
cite psychology study
moral intuitions can conflict with moral dispositions
Either society, or genetics, or some combination, has left me (and most people)
with the disposition to regard the work of women as less valuable than that of
men
This notwithstanding, I have the moral intuition that there is no difference in
value between such work
And it is the intuition that I agree with
sometimes the conflict is won by the disposition
Probably we all have dispositions to regard members of out-groups as morally
suspicious
Consider homosexuals: a politically salient out-group
One very good explanation of why homosexuals have been mistreated is that most
people have dispositions to regard their behavior as morally suspicious
But most peoples' moral intuition says otherwise
Here again, the intuition is what seems to drive belief/judgement for most
people
But consider Catholics: it's not unlikely to think that there are many Catholics
for whom: (a) they have the disposition to regard homosexuals as morally
suspicious (because they are members of an out-group) (b) they have the
intuition that there is nothing morally problematic about homosexual acts, and
yet (c) their moral judgement aligns with their disposition, not their intuition
Reply to the Objection

moral dispositions are not our only grip on morality: we also have moral
intuition
the two are not the same, nor is it obvious that/how they are related
[but what about the "core" cases Street brings up? Peter Singer and speciesism
to the rescue?]
it's far from obvious that "having the moral intuition that p" is capable of
biological heritance, and thus evolutionary selection
people's intuitions change over time, and in unpredictable ways
it's not clear that if we could pick out the neurological correlates to every
instance of what we'd describe as an "intuition" that there would be anything
common to them
ethicists seem to formulate their criteria of goodness/badness based on moral
intuition, not disposition
Objection: Ethicists do not Provide Evidence, they Provide examples of
conclusions already drawn

basically: ethicists are concerned with what constitutes goodness, not what is
evidence for it
reply: granted, but that doesn't mean that they don't/can't bolster evidence for
their claims on the basis of their beliefs about what consistutes goodness
a similar case:
we disagree over whether Elvis is depicted on the TV
if you and I agree that distribution of pixels D constitutes an Elvis depiction,
then evidence for the claim that Elvis is depicted certainly could include
evidence that D was present on the screen

2.2.1. Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Probability
- consider two cases
  - LAZY JIM
    - Lazy Jim is lazy. He just about never empties the dishwasher after running
      it.
    - In the last 1000 times he has run the dishwasher he has emptied it only
      twice
    - Suppose all of this is true and that Jim has just run the dishwasher
    - The following is thus improbable: Jim will empty the dishwasher after it
      runs
    - if we were betting on it, we should bet against his emptying it
  - HURT JIM
    - Hurt Jim is not lazy. He just about always empties the dishwasher after
      running it.
    - In the last 1000 times he has run the dishwasher he has emptied it 998
      times
    - Suppose all of this is true and that Jim has just run the dishwasher
- but shortly thereafter he falls and breaks both his arms
    - The following is thus improbable: Jim will empty the dishwasher after it
      runs
    - if we were betting on it, we should bet against his emptying it
  - in LAZY and HURT JIM, the same event is improbable
- but it is improbable for very different reasons
- in LAZY it is improbable simply in virtue of the distribution of prior events
  - here the improbability is extrinsic to the event
- it gets its probability by “looking outward”, deriving it from other events of
  the same kind
- in HURT it is improbable in virtue of causal facts about the event itself
  - constituents of the event tend to prevent each other from happening
  - here the improbability is intrinsic to the event
- it gets its probability by “looking inward”, deriving it from the way it
  itself is
- these are two different kinds of probability
  - an event can be intrinsically probable while being extrinsically improbable
    - e.g. Jim will go to the hospital after running the dishwasher
  - an event can be intrinsically improbable while being extrinsically probable
    - e.g. Jim will empty the dishwasher after it runs
- I won’t attempt much by way of analysis of these kinds of probability
  - it seems obvious that we use both all the time
  - it also seems obvious that they are distinct
- but it is important to point out the relationship these kinds of probability
  bear to explanation
  - theories which endorse intrinsically improbable events warrant explanation
  - theories which endorse extrinsically improbable events do not warrant
    explanation
  - ex. use the lottery example from your email to yourself
