## Paper  Outline

### Introduction

### The Genetic Fallacy

### Reasons vs. Explanations

### Evidence is Objective

### Street's Main Argument

### Street's Main Conclusion

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Probability

### Evolution of Belief vs Evolution of Feelings
  - beliefs cannot evolve
  - tendencies to believe can evolve, where one has a tendency to believe that p iff it's psychologically easy to believe that p (i.e. believing p reduces stress, reduces anxiety, increases pleasure, is intriniscally desireable)
  
  > "In order for evolution by natural selection to take place with respect to a given trait, the trait in question must be genetically heritable. Yet it is implausible to think that the acceptance of a full-fledged evaluative judgement with a given content [. . .] is a genetically heritable trait. [. . .] In contrast, however, it is plausible to suppose that over the course of much of our evolutionary history, what I have been calling ‘‘more basic evaluative tendencies’’ were genetically heritable traits, where a basic evaluative tendency may be understood very roughly as an unreflective, non-linguistic, motivational tendency to experience something as ‘‘called for’’ or ‘‘demanded’’ in itself, or to experience one thing as ‘‘calling for’’ or ‘‘counting in favor of’’ something else." (118-119)
  > Street says: "My point here is instead the simple and plausible one that had the general content of our basic evaluative tendencies been very different, then the general content of our full-fledged evaluative judgements would also have been very different" (120)
  > "Imagine, for instance, that we had evolved more along the lines of lions, so that males in relatively frequent circumstances had a strong unreflective evaluative tendency to experience the killing of offspring that were not his own as ‘‘demanded by the circumstances,’’ [. . .]  in these and other such cases our system of full-fledged, reflective evaluative judgements would have looked very different as well, and in ways that loosely reflected the basic evaluative tendencies in question." (120-121)
  - Small point: who is this "we" and "our" that she is referring to? Moral philosophers? The folk? Everyone?
  - It's not clear why Street thinks this
  - Given that there is a distinction between having a tendency to believe that p and *actually believing* that p, why should we think that our evaluative beliefs would be different if our evaluative tendencies had been different?
    - One obvious answer is that Street assumes that we believe moral claims *only because* we have the tendency to believe them
    - That is important to note!
    - This explains why she thinks that our "full-fledged evaluative judgements would have been very different [. . .] had the general content of our basic evaluative tendencies been very different"
