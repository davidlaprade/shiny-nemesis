Module 1 : The Genetic Fallacy
Consider inferences of the following form:
	(1) The cause of P's belief that q is C.
	--------------------
	(2) Hence, P's belief that q is unjustified.
These inferences are invalid because it is possible for all of their premises to be true while their conclusions are false. The fact that a person is caused to believe something tells us nothign about the rational justification for his/her view.


Module 2 : Reasons vs. Causes
	There is a difference between a person's reasons for believing that p--i.e. one's rational justification--and the causes of his/her believing that p--i.e. what actually brings about his/her belief. 
	Consider Smith. Smith is a registered member of the Green Party. He registered for the party because he was impressed by Ralph Nader's prudence, intelligence, and philanthropy--all of which he witnessed first hand while visiting his uncle. (His uncle and Nader are good friends.) Upon induction into the Green Party, however, Smith was brainwashed to believe that Nader was the best presidential candidate. As a result, he cannot help but believe it to be the case.
	It seems true to say that Smith has reasons for believing that Nader is the best candidate. He has observed Nader first hand, and has seen that he is prudent, intelligent, and generous. These observations surely count as reasons--albeit defeasible reasons--that Nader is the best candidate for the job. Nevertheless, these reasons are not the causes of Smith's belief. The sole cause is the brainwashing. That alone is sufficient for Smith to believe as he does.
	Contrast Smith with Jones. Jones believes that human beings never landed on the moon. She believes this because she has done extensive research on the conspiracy theory--on the pictures supposedly taken on the moon, on the magnetic fields between it and the earth, about the frailty of the human body in space-like conditions--and has found it very compelling. In this case, the cause of Jones' belief is her reasons: the defeasible (and perhaps defeated) evidence she has for it.
