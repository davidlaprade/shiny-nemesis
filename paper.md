0. Abstract
- there is much to take issue with in Street’s “Darwinian Dilemma”
- I first clarify her case, avoiding needless objections
- then I show how even this strengthened version fails to rationally discredit a
  certain form of realism

§1. Introduction
  Most people believe that scientific claims are true. They get into airplanes,
drive in cars, rely on GPS’s, take medications, and undergo genetic testing.
They do these things because they believe the science behind these inventions.
  Most people believe that ethical claims are true. They vote their consciences,
read op-ed columns, argue with relatives, end friendships, and punish
wrongdoers. They do these things because they believe the ethics behind them.
  Prima facie, there is no contradiction in this. People believe in science and
they believe in ethics. Each has its place in their lives, and each influences
their lives greatly. But as beliefs in disparate domains of knowledge, our
beliefs about science and ethics seem to have little to no bearing on one
another.
  Sharon Street (2006) thinks this is wrong. She thinks that moral realism --
the view that there are mind- and language- independent moral facts -- is at
odds with evolution by natural selection. On her view, what biologists say about
the science of evolution means that what the ethicists say about goodness and
badness is wrong.
  Street’s argument for this conclusion is simple. Our moral dispositions are an
evolved trait. So, if there are moral facts, then they either influenced the
evolution of this trait or they did not. Unfortunately, neither of these options
is acceptable. Hence, there are no moral facts.
  If Street is right, then we have to give up either science or ethics. Either
way, the results for the way we live our lives are catastrophic.
Fortunately, Street is not right. I here defend the view that moral facts did
not influence the evolution of our moral dispositions. I claim that Street’s
arguments do not render this position unacceptable to the realist. I begin in §2
by dealing with some preliminaries. What is moral realism? What is moral
psychology? Then, in §3 I clarify and motivate Street’s case against the
realist. In §4 I elaborate upon the view that I take to avoid Street’s
criticism. Then, in §5-§8 I defend the view against her criticism. The result is
a way of dodging Street’s “Darwinian Dilemma”.

 2. Preliminaries
  - moral intuitions/phenomenology
    - we have a moral psychology
    - we have moral feelings
    - Street talks about “tendencies” and “dispositions”; this is unhelpful and
      unclear
      - she wants to contaminate the epistemic base for our moral beliefs
      - but no one bases their beliefs on their tendencies
      - “Oh ah, I see that I tend to act to promote the lives of my children,
        hence that’s good.”
      - what is a tendency anyway? a distribution of probabilities? genes code
        for probabilities?
      - it seems clearer to say that genes code for biological structures
        (though even that isn’t totally straightforward -- genes citations!)
      - since our moral psychology (presumably) exists in virtue of biological
        structures, this is easy to grasp
  - moral beliefs
    - we seem to have genuine moral beliefs
    - they are genuinely apt bearers of truth values
    - these beliefs seem to often (if not always) be motivated by these feelings
- Moral Realism
- “The defining claim of realism about value [. . .] is that there are at least
  some evaluative facts or truths that hold independently of all our evaluative
attitudes.” 110
- “that hold independently of …” --what is that supposed to mean?
  - the notion of dependence she has in mind is presumably that of grounding
    (citations!!!)
    - examples of grounding: the tv and the image, the statue and the clay
- the defining claim of realism is this: that moral claims are true/false in
  virtue of mind- and language- independent reality
  - why she must have meant something (partially) epistemic
    - almost no one (who makes these kinds of distinctions) thinks our moral
      beliefs hold in virtue of our moral psychology
    - at most, they are using our psychology as evidence
    - similarly: no one thinks our beliefs about electrons are true in virtue of
      the readings on our instruments
    - rather, they are true in virtue of the way electrons actually are!
    - if the machines and particle accelerators were all destroyed, our beliefs
      would still be true
    - what Street intends to undermine--or should intend to undermine--is the
      evidence for moral beliefs
  - thus we get that realism = moral beliefs are true/false in virtue of mind-
    and language- independent reality, and that at least some of them constitute
knowledge

3. A Darwinian Dilemma?
  - our moral psychology is an evolved trait
    - evidence from broad cultural agreement
    - evidence from similarities with other animals
- “Like us, individual chimpanzees seem to experience  at some basic
  motivational level  actions that would promote their survival or help their
offspring as in some way ‘‘called for.’’ More strikingly, and again at some
basic motivational level, chimpanzees seem to experience the fact that another
chimpanzee has helped them, whether by sharing food, grooming them, or
supporting their position within the group hierarchy, as ‘‘counting in favor
of’’ assisting that other individual in similar ways.” 117
    - the best explanation of these facts is that the trait is evolved
  - if it is evolved, then it was selected for directly or indirectly
    - direct vs indirect selection
- There are two and only two ways for any given trait to evolve: either it can
  be selected for directly or it can be selected for indirectly. A trait is
selected for iff organisms with that trait are fitter (have a greater propensity
to leave offspring) than those without the trait, all else being equal.
Selection is then direct iff the trait itself is the cause of the fitness
increase, and indirect otherwise. (cite waters)
  - it wasn’t selected for indirectly
    - she settles this one from the armchair
-  [N]ote the [enormous] costs and benefits, as measured in the Darwinian
   currency of reproductive success, of accepting some evaluative judgements
rather than others. It is clear, for instance, how fatal to reproductive success
it would be to judge that the fact that something would endanger one’s survival
is a reason to do it, or that the fact that someone is kin is a reason to harm
that individual. A creature who accepted such evaluative judgements would run
itself off cliffs, seek out its predators, and assail its offspring, resulting
in the speedy elimination of it and its evaluative tendencies from the world .
114
    - objection:
- it’s not the judging that’s fatal, its the acting upon
- so here the phenomenology is really piggy backing on the tendency to act a
  certain way
- in a way she almost admits this in admitting that the acting tendencies
  probably came before the judgments
“Behavioral and motivational tendencies in the direction of at least some of the
pairings of circumstance and response on this list presumably arose and became
entrenched in our ancestors long before the rise of any capacity for
full-fledged evaluative judgement” 118
    - objection 2:
      - this is armchair biology and the great trap of adaptationism
      - anything can seem an adaptation if one’s imagination is good enough
      - and likewise anything can seem maladaptive with the right insights
        - plausibly ancient man could have had confused beliefs about who his
          kin were, about what promoted his survival, etc.
        - it might have actually been to his disadvantage to follow such
          “tendencies”
      - the point: things are only adaptive relative to environments
      - and what we are being given no information about is what the state of
        ancient man’s environment was like
      - so if we’re really going to be taking our biology seriously, we
        shouldn’t be taking this line of argument seriously
    - for these two reasons, this claim is poorly defended
  - this actually isn’t going to matter
    - officially, I propose we drop it from her statement from the problem
    - all Street needs to get her argument off the ground is that it was an
      evolved trait
- she states her Dilemma as a matter of declaring a relationship
“The basic problem for realism is that it needs to take a position on what
relation there is, if any, between the selective forces that have influenced the
content of our evaluative judgements, on the one hand, and the independent
evaluative truths that realism posits, on the other.” 121
- this is unclear: what is she asking the realist to provide? -- a relation?
- The way most philosophers use the word “relation” only objects--only
  things--bear relations to one another.
- (Schaffer citation, relations require relata)
- But forces and truths aren’t objects.
- So, unless she has some idiosyncratic meaning of “relation” in mind, what is
  she talking about?
- this is one of the ways in which Street’s argument generates unnecessary chaff
- I think she wants the realist to answer the following question:
  - did the truthmakers of moral claims affect the way our moral psychology
    evolved-- and if so, how?
- the dilemma is thus the following:
- either the truthmakers of moral claims affected the way our moral psychology
  evolved or they didn’t
- no matter which the the realist chooses, he/she seems to be in trouble
- the argument for this final premise is a somewhat tortured shotgun blast
-it’s a let’s-prove-it-by-examining-every-possibility-we-can-think-of argument
  - so I will not rehearse it here

4. The Negative View
- the solution I propose is to embrace the negative view: that the truthmakers
  of moral claims did not affect the way our moral psychology evolved
  - call a moral realist that adopts such a view a negative realist
  - the negative realist says that moral psychology would have evolved as it did
    whether or not moral claims were true
  - moral psychology did not evolve as it did in any way because of the
    truthmakers of moral claims
- I think this view is plausible for independent reasons
  - moral properties would seem to not have causal properties
  - if they did, we could just detect them scientifically; we can’t, so they
    don’t
  - but if they lack causal properties, then they can’t have affected
    evolutionary processes one way or the other
  - QeD
- we can also see that by taking the negative view, it doesn’t matter whether
  moral psychology was selected for directly or indirectly
  - either way, on this view the genesis of our moral psychology was unaffected
    by the truthmakers of moral claims
  - hence, the forces which determined the constitution of our moral psychology
    were random with respect to the truth of moral claims
  - similarly: the forces which shaped the grand canyon were random with respect
    to its beauty
    - if some bit of moral psychology happens to be veridical, this is by random
      chance
    - if the Grand Canyon happens to be beautiful (as it does), this was by
      random chance
- this solution comes with baggage
  - the forces which determined the constitution of our moral psychology were
    random with respect to the truth of moral claims
  - random picking is fine when doing so from a pool of mostly good choices
  - unfortunately there was no such friendly pool from which evolution randomly
    chose our moral psychology
  - one important point that Street makes is to stress the range of possible
    moral beliefs
“Imagine, for instance, that we had evolved more along the lines of lions, so
that males in relatively frequent circumstances had a strong unreflective
evaluative tendency to experience the killing of offspring that were not his own
as ‘‘demanded by the circumstances,’’ and so that females, in turn, experienced
no strong unreflective tendency to ‘‘hold it against’’ a male when he killed her
offspring in such circumstances, on the contrary becoming receptive to his
advances soon afterwards. Or imagine that we had evolved more along the lines of
our close primate relatives the bonobos, so that we experienced sexual relations
with all kinds of different partners as ‘‘called for’’ in all kinds of different
circumstances. Finally, imagine that we had evolved more on the model of the
social insects, perhaps possessing overwhelmingly strong unreflective evaluative
tendencies in the direction of devoting ourselves to the welfare of the entire
community, and only the weakest tendency to look out for our own individual
survival, being unreflectively inclined to view that survival as ‘‘good’’ only
insofar as it was of some use to the larger community.” 120-121
    - the pool of possible moral judgements dwarfs the pool of true moral
      judgements by orders of magnitude
  - just as picking randomly from a jar is unlikely to produce a red marble when
    reds are outnumbered 1000 to 1
  - so too is it unlikely that that a randomly constituted moral psychology
    would point to true beliefs
  - we are left with the conclusion: it is unlikely that our moral psychology
    points to true beliefs
- this isn’t yet a denial of realism
  - to do that we need to (at the very least) show how this entails that we’re
    unjustified in believing moral claims
  - but by now that doesn’t seem so hard
- my goal for the remainder of this paper is to consider what I take to be the
  most plausible arguments against the negative realist
  - while all plausible I claim that none is ultimately successful
  - hence, I say that there is no dilemma for the negative realist
- the arguments are
our dispositions probably point to false beliefs, we follow our dispositions, so
we probably have false beliefs
it would be a huge coincidence if evolution guided us to the right beliefs;
there are no such coincidences 
moral psychology is ultimately the only evidence anyone has for morality; this
shows us our evidence is no good
we’d think as we do even if the claims were false; hence, our process is
unreliable

5.0 The Argument from Probability
- it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true
  beliefs
- most of our moral beliefs correspond to our moral dispositions
- hence, probably most of our moral beliefs are false
- if realism is true, then it’s not the case that probably most of our moral
  beliefs are false
- hence, realism is false
- Street seems to have this in mind when she says:
- [T]he forces of natural selection must be viewed as a purely distorting
  influence on our evaluative judgements, having pushed us in evaluative
directions that have nothing whatsoever to do with the evaluative truth. On this
view, allowing our evaluative judgements to be shaped by evolutionary influences
is analogous to setting out for Bermuda and letting the course of your boat be
determined by the wind and tides: just as the push of the wind and tides on your
boat has nothing to do with where you want to go, so the historical push of
natural selection on the content of our evaluative judgements has nothing to do
with evaluative truth. 121-122
- If we take this point and combine it with the first premise that our
  evaluative judgements have been tremendously shaped by Darwinian influence,
then we are left with the implausible skeptical conclusion that our evaluative
judgements are in all likelihood mostly off track, for our system of evaluative
judgements is revealed to be utterly saturated and contaminated with
illegitimate influence. 122

5.1 Probable Given the Evidence
- the probability of an event is always relative to a pool of evidence
  - probabilities are almost never stagnant
  - when that pool of evidence changes, so too does the probability
  - whether or not an event is going to happen is (presumably) fixed
  - probabilities reflect the strength of evidence we have about what is going
    to happen
- the assessment of probability for an event always begins with its base rate
  - the base rate R of an event type E = (df) the probability that any event of
    type E will occur, calculated as the average probability of each prior
instance
  - one calculates the base rate knowing nothing about the particulars of E’s
    instances
  - it’s what you would calculate if all you knew were the rates of occurrence
    of prior E type events
  - example
- suppose that in recorded history there have been 100,000 people who have
  smoked at least a pack of cigarettes a day for 20 years
    - suppose that among the 12,000 developed lung cancer
    - taking nothing else into account, then, we can say that the base rate of
      getting lung cancer for a person who smokes a pack a day for 20 years is
12%
- the base rate of an event reflects the probability of that event with respect
  to a certain bare-minimum pool of evidence
- suppose we are trying to figure out the probability that it will rain at a
  certain place on a given day in June-- June 22nd
  - suppose we are the weather channel
  - say that reliable records have been kept about the weather at this place for
    100 years
  - say that 30 of such years were years in which it rained
  - the base rate of its raining on June 22nd at this place is thus 30%
  - now, June 20th arrives and our viewership wants to know the likelihood of
    rain on the 22nd
  - there is now additional evidence which we can bring to bear on this event
    - we can see that there is a certain storm system at such-and-such a
      position from this place
    - suppose the base rate of there being this kind of storm at this location
      on June 20th is 5%
    - and suppose that 3 of the 30 years that it rained on the 22nd there was
      such a storm at such a location
  - using Bayes’ theorem, we can calculate a revised probability given the new
    evidence we have
P(A|B) = P(B|A) x P(A)
        P(B)
A = it rains June 22nd this year
B = there is a storm at such and such a location on June 20th
P(A) = base rate of 30%
P(B) = base rate of 5%
P(B|A) = probability that there was a storm at that location on June 20th given
that it rained June 22nd - 10%
P(A|B) = 0.1 x 0.3 / 0.05 = .6
- this much should seem intuitive
  - the probability of an event (quantum mechanics excluded) is not a fixed
    value
  - it changes as we revise the pool of evidence we have for that event
  - it changes in a way that we can calculate
  - just as it would be a mistake for the weather channel to stop at base rates
    in its predictions of future weather events it would be a mistake for us to
stop at the base rate in our calculations of the events we’re interested in

5.2 The First Argument Reconsidered
- here’s the argument again
- it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true
  beliefs
- most of our moral beliefs correspond to our moral dispositions
- hence, probably most of our moral beliefs are false
- if realism is true, then it’s not the case that probably most of our moral
  beliefs are false
- hence, realism is false
- the problem with this first way of bridging the gap is that it ignores
  whatever other evidence we might have for our moral beliefs
- consider an analogous argument
  - imagine a person, Smith, who believes only a few very basic mathematical
    expressions: “2 + 3 = 5”, “9 - 1 = 8”, and “8 * 7 = 56”
  - now imagine a computer picks random sentences out of the set of
    syntactically correct, basic arithmetical sentences
- suppose that the set of sentences it returns is identical to the set of
  mathematical sentences Smith believes
  - now, it is very unlikely that a computer picking randomly from this set will
    produce a true sentence of mathematics
  - the set of syntactically correct mathematical expressions is orders of
    infinity larger than the set of true mathematical expressions
  - should Smith thus doubt his mathematical beliefs?
  - should he conclude that they are probably false?
  - if this is all the evidence he had, then yes he should
  - but this is not all of the evidence he has; indeed, it’s only just the base
    rate
- here, the problem is that we’re confusing the base rate for the final rate
  - there’s a wider body of evidence to take into consideration when evaluating
    the probability of a mathematical expression
    - was the expression taught to us by a reliable source?
    - are there any good proofs of the expression?
    - can it be confirmed empirically, e.g. by counting fingers?
  - to only take the base rate into account in evaluating the probability of the
    view is to tacitly assume something that is false
- namely: that the base rate takes into account all of the evidence we have one
  way or the other for the view
  - and in the case of mathematics the omission is so obvious that no one would
    make this mistake
- my claim is that this way of closing the gap is (in all important respects)
  identical to the mathematical argument run above
  - Street has succeeded in showing two things:
    - that the pool of possible moral judgements dwarfs the pool of true moral
      judgments (if any there are)
    - our beliefs correspond to sentences picked by a random process from this
      pool
  - Note the similarity to Smith’s case
    - the pool of possible mathematical judgements dwarfs the pool of true
      mathematical judgments (if any there are)
    - Smith’s beliefs correspond to sentences picked by a random process from
      this pool
  - but it seemed obvious in Smith’s case that he should not doubt his
    mathematical beliefs just because of this
  - so too, then for us and our moral beliefs
  - to think otherwise is to be engaged in the weatherman’s fallacy of confusing
    base rates for final rates
  - this is the further gap that besets the first way of closing the gap between
    Street’s sub conclusion and main conclusion

6.0 The Argument from Best Explanation
- the argument is:
- it is very unlikely that our moral dispositions are dispositions to true
  beliefs
- most of our moral beliefs correspond to our moral dispositions
- if (1) and (2) then it would be a remarkable coincidence if our moral beliefs
  were true
- coincidences require explanation in order for us to be justified in accepting
  them
- there is no good explanation of such a coincidence
- hence, something has to be given up: the only plausible candidate is that our
  beliefs are true
- hence, our beliefs are not true: realism is false
- textual evidence that this is what Street has in mind
- Of course it’s possible that as a matter of sheer chance, some large portion
  of our evaluative judgements ended up true, due to a happy coincidence between
the realist’s independent evaluative truths and the evaluative directions in
which natural selection tended to push us, but this would require a fluke of
luck that’s not only extremely unlikely, in view of the huge universe of
logically possible evaluative judgements and truths, but also astoundingly
convenient to the realist. Barring such a coincidence, the only conclusion
remaining is that many or most of our evaluative judgements are off track. 122
6.1 Improbability and Mechanism
- consider a routine lottery drawing
  - I go to buy a PowerBall ticket and have the number generated randomly
- tomorrow comes and a number is drawn: it’s my number!
- suppose someone told you this story and that you didn’t have a way of
  verifying it’s truth
- would you say:
    - “really--your number was drawn?” (eyebrows raised with doubt)
- “that’s a very big coincidence, don’t you think?”
- “tell me then, if this really happened as you say, how did it happen?”
- “how did that random machine manage to select exactly your random number just
  when you wanted it to?”
- would a mechanism be called for in such a case?
- should you be skeptical about this story until one was provided?
- it seems not: you’re claiming that the process was random and you just got
  lucky
- there is nothing to explain
- skepticism in such a circumstance does not seem warranted
  - this even despite the fact that the odds of picking a winning lottery number
    are staggeringly low
  - we just don’t need anyone to be able to explain how this happened in order
    to accept that it did
- consider a different story
  - I just smashed your windshield ten minutes ago. Shattered it to pieces.
  - But right after I just felt so bad. So I replaced it. If you go outside now
    you’ll see it just as you left it
- suppose someone told you this story and you didn’t have a way of verifying
  it’s truth
  - here I think you would say:
    - “really--you replaced a windshield in just ten minutes?” (brow furrowed
      with suspicion)
    - “you just happened to have the right cut of glass for my make and model,
      and the tools at the ready?”
- “you cleaned up all that glass?”
- “you managed to acquire new inspection stickers and parking passes to my golf
  club?”
- “tell me then, if this really happened as you say, how did it happen?”
- “how did you manage to do all of this in so little time?”
- here you really should be doubtful of the truth of the story until a mechanism
  was provided
- it would really seem like a giant coincidence if all of the conditions were so
  as to make what you claim possible
- so why does one story demand a mechanism and the other not?
- both stories are improbable
  - it is improbable that someone would win the lottery
  - it is improbable that someone would repair a shattered windshield in 10
    minutes
- neither story can be independently verified
- answer: we are assessing their probabilities from very different evidential
  bases
  - for the lottery: the evidential base is just the base rate
- the number of possible winning combinations, and the fact that the drawing was
  random
  - for the windshield: the evidential base is not a base rate, but is rather a
    large collection of general causal facts
    - e.g. it takes time to find the right windshield for a car and clean up
      glass and procure replacement parking passes
- what we see:
  - when something is picked randomly from a large number of possibilities (and
    this is all we know about it) it is indeed improbable
  - but it is not a coincidence: it does not demand a mechanism
  - mechanisms seem to be demanded only when the causal facts seem to render
    something unlikely

6.2 Against the Argument from Best Explanation
- suppose the realist bites the bullet here and just says we got lucky
- which of the above stories does the evolution of morality (according to
  Street) more closely resemble?
  - the lottery, not the windshield
- why?
  - whatever traits our moral dispositions have been piggy-backing on are best
    thought of as having no relation to the truth/falsity of moral claims
    - so claims Street, anyway… quote??
  - what ended up selecting our dispositions, in other words, was random with
    respect to the truth/falsity of the moral claims it picked
    - a moral claim’s being true did not cause it to be any more or less likely
      to be chosen; ditto for being false
  - so Street is claiming that if we follow our moral dispositions, it’s as good
    as picking randomly
  - but picking randomly is only risky if there are many bad choices in the
    bunch: if the numbers are bad
    - this is why she points out that there are many possible moral judgements
      that our dispositions could have corresponded to
    - (if the moral realist is to be taken at his/her word) the number of
      possible moral judgements dwarfs the number of true moral judgements by
orders of magnitude
    - so again, the numbers are bad too
- these are exactly the circumstances we had in the lottery case
  - recall, the lottery case did not require a mechanism in order to be
    plausible
- so I deny the third premise here: if (1) and (2) then it would be a remarkable
  coincidence if our moral beliefs were true
  - there is no coincidence here
- the problem with this way of bridging the gap is that it mistakenly assumes
  that when the co-occurrence of an event pair is unlikely, it constitutes a
coincidence (something requiring explanation to be justifiably believed)
  - but this is not so
  - it is thus the further hole in this manner of patching Street’s case

7.0 No Epistemic Base
  - moral psychology is the sole source of evidence for moral claims
  - if the negative realist is right, then that evidence is bad evidence
  - hence, there is no good evidence for moral claims
  - hence, moral claims are unjustified
  - hence they don’t constitute knowledge
  - hence realism is wrong
- quote from Street
- The widespread consensus that the method of reflective equilibrium, broadly
  understood, is our sole means of proceeding in ethics is an acknowledgment of
this fact: ultimately, we can test our evaluative judgements only by testing
their consistency with our other evaluative judgements, combined of course with
judgements about the (non-evaluative) facts. 124

7.1 Reply
the first premise has to be what’s wrong here
it seems that it’s far from being a consensus view that “reflective equilibrium
[. . .] is our sole means of proceeding in ethics”
Kantians: evidence comes from the categorical imperatives
Utilitarians: evidence is evidence of pain/pleasure
Aristotelians: evidence for virtue is what the virtuous man does
Natural Goodness: good is just what promotes flourishing (cite Phillippa Foot)
Cornell Realists: evidence is high-level claims about flourishing (cite Brink)
Searle-style approaches
reply: this misses the point, these things only constitute evidence because a
general metaethical view has already been adopted (e.g. that such-and-such
constitutes goodness)
but the only evidence for this kind of view is moral psychology
so this just pushes the problem back
on its face, this claim is incredible--and surely the kind of thing that
requires further argument
a huge amount of ink has been spilt for thousands of years attempting to give
such metaethical claims independent justification
to dismiss that literature out of hand would seem crazy
the burden of proof is on Street’s end here
this is a burden she hasn’t met

8.0 Explanation of Belief
there is one further argument lingering Street’s paper
"[H]ad the general content of our basic evaluative tendencies been very
different, then the general content of our full-fledged evaluative judgements
would also have been very different" (120) "Imagine, for instance, that we had
evolved more along the lines of lions, so that males in relatively frequent
circumstances had a strong unreflective evaluative tendency to experience the
killing of offspring that were not his own as ‘‘demanded by the circumstances,’’
[. . .] in these and other such cases our system of full-fledged, reflective
evaluative judgements would have looked very different as well, and in ways that
loosely reflected the basic evaluative tendencies in question." (120-121)
it’s hard to see why she thinks this, if not because she thinks that we believe
moral claims only because of our dispositions
the best explanation of our beliefs is our moral psychology
you can prop ethics up on whatever intellectual stilts you desire; it won’t
change this fact
argument:
we believe our moral claims only because of our dispositions
our dispositions are as good as random
hence, we lack knowledge of moral claims
hence, realism is false

8.1 Reasons vs. Explanations
There is a difference between a person's reasons for believing that p--i.e.
one's rational justification--and the best explanation of his/her believing that
p--i.e. what actually accounts for his/her belief.
Consider Smith. Smith is a registered member of the Green Party. He registered
for the party because he was impressed by Ralph Nader's prudence, intelligence,
and philanthropy--all of which he witnessed first hand while visiting his uncle
(suppose). Upon induction into the Green Party, however, Smith was brainwashed
to believe that Nader is the best presidential candidate. As a result, he cannot
help but believe it to be the case.
It seems true to say that Smith has reasons for believing that Nader is the best
candidate. He has observed Nader first hand, and has seen that he is prudent,
intelligent, and generous. These observations surely count as reasons--albeit
defeasible reasons--that Nader is the best candidate for the job. Nevertheless,
these reasons are not the explanation of Smith's belief. The explanation is the
brainwashing. That alone is sufficient for Smith to believe as he does.
Contrast Smith with Jones. Jones believes that human beings never landed on the
moon. She believes this because she has done extensive research on the
conspiracy theory--on the pictures supposedly taken on the moon, on the magnetic
fields between it and the earth, about the frailty of the human body in space,
etc.--and has found it all very compelling. In this case, the explanation of
Jones' belief is her reasons: the defeasible (and perhaps defeated) evidence she
has for it. The evidence is what makes her believe as she does.

8.2 The Genetic Fallacy
Consider inferences of the following form:
(1) P believes that q only because of E.
--------------------
(2) Hence, P's belief that q is unjustified.
Here are some examples:
Jim believes that abortion should be illegal only because he wants to control
women.
--------
Hence, Jim's belief is unjustified.

Jan believes that global climate change is real only because she is a Democrat.
-------
Hence, Jan's belief is unjustified.

Francine believes that babies are fun only because she is a woman.
-------
Hence, Francine's belief is unjustified.
These inferences are as common as they are tempting, but they are all invalid.
They are examples of what's called the Genetic Fallacy, schematized above. That
schema is fallacious because it is possible for all of its premises to be true
while its conclusions are false. The fact that a person's belief can be
explained tells us nothing about the rational justification (if any) for his/her
view. To think otherwise, it seems, is to conflate reasons with explanations.

8.3 Reply
This argument is simply fallacious. It’s an example of the genetic fallacy

9.0 Conclusion
Street has not shown that there is any dilemma for moral realism
