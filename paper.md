Module 1 : The Genetic Fallacy
Consider inferences of the following form:
	(1) The cause of P's belief that q is C.
	--------------------
	(2) Hence, P's belief that q is unjustified.
These inferences are invalid because it is possible for all of their premises to be true while their conclusions are false. The fact that a person is caused to believe something tells us nothign about the rational justification for his/her view.
